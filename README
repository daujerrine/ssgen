SSGen - Static Site Generator
=============================
Current Version - 0.1.0 NotUsable

SSGen is a program that was made because the author refused to learn or use
things like Jekyll, Hugo, or whatever there is in the market. A lot of these 
programs utilise javascript, "web" frameworks, a lot of dependent libraries
which the author considers "unwanted bloat".
SSGen aims to be as straightforward as possible in its approach. You let SSGen 
know about a template, and a set of 'source' files containing information to 
be pasted on that template, and specify the destination directory where the 
processed files should be put.

      Source + Template  ----> Desired HTML file
      File     File

In essence, SSGen is a general template processing program. General in the sense
that it could be used for things other than html files. The author doesn't 
know if another similar, more sophisticated program exists or not and is too 
lazy to look around any longer (the c preprocessor may be one such example but 
it is specific to c's syntax). However, it does include a few additions that 
make it differ from a standard templating program.

There are examples available in this folder which describe the syntax and
working of SSGen.

Installation
-------------
This script (ssgen.pl) can be used right out of the box without any additional 
configuration aside from having perl 5 (v 5.26.1 and above is recommended).
If required, executing:

    sudo make install

in this directory will copy ssgen.pl to /usr/local/bin, rename it to ssgen and
mark it executable.
